# Voron-FCC-Toolhead-Board

This is a hartk style toolhead board that is ment to be paired with the FFC cable kit (https://www.schmidtproto.com/product-page/voron-2-4-ffc-mod-kit). The board uses the same mounting holes as the origional hartk board and should be a drop in replacement. This board is based off the Enraged Rabit project board which means it has support for a filament sensor. I also added the option to run a secondary voltage sorce so that fans, bed leveling sensors, and filament sensors could be run at a different voltage from the 24v. I currently have 2 versions of the boards. One uses the traditional microfit connector and the other uses a 90 degree XT30 connector for the hotend heater. All of the connectors have been replaced with 90 degree versions so that wires don't stick out as much. Depending on the board, some of the connectors will be mounted to the back side of the PCB, this was done because the 90 degree connectors take up more space. This shouldn't however interfear with anything and should be fully acceible. The only difference being that a larger spacer is needed when mounting it to the toolhead.
